# Full-Stack Development Portfolio
This repository will host the code of the projects completed while learning to use HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, JQuery and Django

After completing learning, these will be moved to a professional Portfolio page, where each of the sites will display from links provided

## HTML
Here are projects only dealing with pure HTML. The current items include:
* Basic HTML with link to other pages
* Sample submission form

## CSS
Here are projects conatining elements of both HTML and CSS:
* Recreating the painting "Spectrum V" by Ellsworth Kelly, with custom color scheme. For flair, I added additional items and a hyperlinked image
